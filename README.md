# go-complete-web

Simple autocomplete web application in Go.

I used:
 - [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
 - [htmz](https://github.com/Kalabasa/htmz) to load stuff
 - [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) and [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) to make things pretty
 - [templ](https://templ.guide/) to generate HTML
 - [go-approval-tests](https://github.com/approvals/go-approval-tests) to verify HTML
